# This program is to be used as calculator to record my wins/losses. I would also like for it to capture other market data and be able to compare them to my results.

# What is my batting score (per day?, per trade?)
# Green / Red day for month

# TODO: - DONE - Clean the data up from csv file using csv and pandas 

# TODO: Write program to build the dataframe and do calculations

# TODO: Store data to database?

# TODO: Display results on a web interface

# TODO: Formula to find out BUY / SELL and OPEN / CLOSE

# What is my batting score (per day?, per trade?)
# Green / Red day for month

# * Batting Score Calculations
# 1 = win, 0 = loss
# count(total wins), count(total losses) divided by total
# If Green > Red : "Green Day" Else: "Red Day"

# Date Time > Strike > Exp > Symbol > Side > Qty > Pos Effect
# Pull price bought from subtracted by price sold = profit/loss
